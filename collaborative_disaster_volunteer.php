                                    <p>

                                       “The tragic attack of September 11th has taught us many things, not the least of which is that we must protect our Ready Responders, the people that come out to help others in their most desperate time of need” says Lisa Orloff, Founder of World Cares Center.

                                        Since 2001, disasters have increased in frequency and in severity. We are faced with compound issues and a rising number of constituents in need. Our organizations are also tasked with finding new ways to serve while keeping everyone safe. How do we tackle such a mounting challenge while remaining resilient and healthy ourselves?

                                        A board of advisors has joined forces to create a three-tiered Cooperative Disaster Volunteer Credential training program that provides a solid foundation of knowledge for any disaster volunteer. Founded in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11th, the World Cares Center and its partners understand the need to train all types of volunteers to work together safely and with a common understanding of how things should get done. Often grassroots groups do not have the resources to develop and deliver their own training, and this is where the Cooperative comes in. New members are encouraged to join this collaborative movement that improves our ability to work together, share resources, and reduce responder injuries.
